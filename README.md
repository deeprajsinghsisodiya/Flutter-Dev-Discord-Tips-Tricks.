Q. Do any of the routing packages let you have multiple routing stacks?  i.e. to allow a user to have two or more "stateful" screens and they can move around those screens almost as if they were independent apps.  Each screen would have its own path/stack and stateful things like scroll position and selected tab and highlighted text or whatever.
